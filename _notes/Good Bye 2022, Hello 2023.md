## Plans for the site in 2023

First goal for 2023 is to ensure the domain renewal in early February. I already have \$20 Cad of the approx. \$35 Cad needed set aside. In my past attempts at making a personal site, I would be able to get the domain only to not have the money to afford the renewal. Part of the problem being the initial cost being significantly lower. It only cost me ~\$8 Cad to purchase the domain each time, but \$30 - \$35 Cad to renew it. I got lucky that I could reclaim my preferred address each time but I won't be taking chances this time around.

Additionally, I plan on making more posts. I've tried in the past, formal writing being my Kryptonite. I have no problem coming up with content in my head while in the shower or out on a walk, but when I sit down and try to type it up I get stuck and feel like it is not gonna happen. When working on the [Anti-NFT's V1](../_notes/Anti-NFT's%20V1.md) project, I found just having Obsidian open and making notes as I worked lead to me being able to write about what I was working on. So with that in mind let me announce my big project of 2023.

## "12 Months 12 Banners"

The idea came to me when I joined Mastodon earlier this month. Each month I create a new banner using p5js. So far I have 7 ideas to draw from and the first I plan on doing is called "**Blinking Lights on the Dark Horizon**". 

This theme is inspired by the blinking lights I have seen on the outskirts of the city on my late night walks. There are 4 communication towers, side by side in the distance, where the top red lights blink at different times. Why are they out of sync, will they ever sync up, were they supposed to be synced? These are some of the questions that come to mind when I see them. They are not visible during the day so I can't get a good look at the towers to determine why they are as close as they are or what purpose they might serve.

Some of the other themes I have planned but not named:
- Hills & Horizon
- Birds on a wire
- Farm Sim
- Patchwork Landscape
- Dice Mural Banner
- Hawaiian Shirt Pattern

## Other Goals

In addition to the p5js projects, I hope to get a start on creating some elements for when I get a chance to start going to conventions in cosplay. I will be bringing my first DnD character to life, The Lost Sorcerer. So far I have some of the materials available to create a magic staff. I need to figure out a good way of masking the inside of a plastic snow globe to make the magic orb that will top the staff. 

The other cosplay I have in mind is Time Traveller. I have been reading and rereading the "In Times Like These" and "Paradox PI" books by Nathan Van Coops. I love how he has established the rules for time travel, using anchors to ensure you arrive when and where you expect to go. The key piece I need for this cosplay is a Chronometer. Since I am Aphantasic I only have the descriptions in the books to work from, and they feel like they are piece meal each section described without consideration for the whole design. Fortunately the Chronometers are all bespoke designs allowing me to design my own that feels like it belongs with all the rest, while being something I can make myself.
