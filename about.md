### About Me

My name is Dan and I am a 30 year old Canadian guy with interests in programming, programmatic art, cosplay, and gaming (tabletop and video games). While I have not been all that successful in my past 30 years, my goal is to find my true passions.

### About the Site

A place for me to post about my projects, interests and random musings. 

### Brief About Aphantasia

In late 2018 / early 2019 I realized I was Aphantasic, meaning I have no minds eye unable to visualize things. Now I was Aphantasic as far back as I can recall, however it wasn't until I finally watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewsGmhAjjjI) that I learned the name. This condition had little impact on me growing up. It was only when I started playing D&D in college when I started to understand something was different about my mind. Theater of the mind was off the table for combat, but I can just get by with adventuring by taking notes of what the DM said.

I still love to read with my first proper novel being 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone' when I was 7, still able to dream though I don't recall dreaming very often (the ones I have recalled being semi lucid and hyper realistic).
